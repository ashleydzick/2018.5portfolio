        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Like many people in User Experience, my path here took quite a few turns. As a kid, I never really knew what I wanted to be when I wanted to grow up. My first “real” dream job was to be an English professor, because I wanted to teach. By the time I got to high school, I was absolutely in love with my AP Physics and Math courses. I went to an engineering school but then ended up majoring in business. After a number of years as a software engineer, I stumbled into user experience. I worked for a startup as a UI designer before coming on as a full time UXer.
        </p>
        <p>Now I'm nearly a decade into my user experience career. I've been a UX consultant for four years, working with firms of all sizes to start and expand their UX capabilities. I’ve done everything from multi-tiered complex research strategies to sitting with teams and helping with their day-to-day deliverables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of consulting, I have a number of other activities. I teach at Milwaukee School of Engineering and volunteer at the <a href="https://mpl.org/archives/wisconsin_architectural_archives.php">Wisconsin&nbsp;Architecture&nbsp;Archive.</a> I’m learning American Sign Language and getting back into homebrewing after a several year hiatus.
        </p>
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>My goal is to educate businesses, students, and everyone around me about UX, a hugely important part of their product platform. I love being able to mentor individuals and foster the community. I’m excited about the progression of UX on the coasts and I want to grow that same spirit in the midwest.
