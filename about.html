      <h1 class="small-title">My Philosophy</h1>
      <dib class="section">
        <p>When I was 11, my first “real” dream job was to be an English professor, because I wanted to teach. By the time I got to high school, I was absolutely in love with my AP Physics and Math courses. I committed to an engineering school for Computer Engineering. While I found hardware and C fascinating, I missed having a direct connection to users. I wanted to be able to talk to people and be able to actually measure their progress. After a number of years as a software engineer, I stumbled into user experience.
        </p>
        <p>Now, nearly a decade into my user experience career, my goal is to educate businesses, students and everyone around me about a hugely important part of their product platform. I love being able to mentor individuals and foster the UX community. I’m excited about the progression of UX on the coasts and I want to grow that same spirit in the midwest.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I’m a UX Consultant at a software company, working with firms of all sizes to start and expand their UX capabilities. Over the past three years with SafeNet, I’ve done everything from multi-tiered complex research strategies to sitting with teams and helping with their day-to-day deliverables.
