      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p><a href="safenetmke.com">SafeNet Consulting</a> had an out-of-date website that didn’t appropriately reflect their brand or
          technology capabilities. The company had two branches with completely different clientele and a
          half-hearted attempt to make them look similar. SafeNet’s Milwaukee office was looking to modernize
          their web presence so they could stop selling solely by word-of-mouth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>I analyzed both SafeNet’s current web presence, as well as their competition to come up with a list of features they had and were missing. I worked with sales and stakeholders to develop personas and basic scenarios. Using those as a lens for the website, I developed a site map and detailed information architecture.
        </p>
        <p>Once the Information Architecture was developed, I brought in a designer. She worked on style and branding updates while I worked on wireframes and content. The designer then iterated on the wireframes, producing detailed prototypes that I was able to usability test. I also conducted thorough accessibility analysis, on designs and on developer implementation, as SafeNet needed a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">WCAG Level AA Compliant</a> website as they competed in the healthcare and financial industries.
        </p>

        <ul class="styled-list">

          <li>Accessibility Analysis</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>SafeNet brought their digital presence from outdated to modern. Their SEO rankings soared and customer visits increased by 800% within the first few months after launch. We were able to produce a modern looking website that was completely WCAG Level AA compliant with many parts Level AAA compliant.</p>
