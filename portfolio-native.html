      <h1 class="small-title">Native iOS and Android for Milwaukee Tool</h1>
      <p class="italics">Industries: eCommerce, Manufacturing</p>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Milwaukee Tool is a power tool company based in Brookfield, Wisconsin. They had a number of ongoing projects and new developments they wanted to bring to ONE-KEY, their bluetooth enabled power tool platform, but did not have the resources to develop all needed screens.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>I worked with Milwaukee Tool for sixteen months, September 2015 to December 2017. Using a style guide I had previously developed, I split the iOS and Android apps from one style to two distinct applications. Over the course of a year, we were able to nearly completely redesign the apps.
        </p>
        <p>While also updating older screens, the majority of my time was spent on adding or changing workflows. I personally developed a new on-boarding and login process, humanized their legalese, updated their “Tool Connect” and “Add Item” workflows and several smaller other projects. I worked alongside several developers and industrial designers on a number of physical products.

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>Visual Design (incorporating Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design)</li>
          <li>Journey Mapping / Workflows</li>
          <li>Mockups</li>
          <li>Prototyping</li>
          <li>Style Guide</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Customer reviews on the Android app store went up from 2.7 to 3.6 (out of five stars). The iOS application went from a 3.9 to a 4.1. We were able to completely modernize their style and quickly iterated through new projects, instead of redesigning everything.
