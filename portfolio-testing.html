        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>A local eCommerce company had a team of visual designers who produced elegant pixel-perfect mockups, but had very little data to back up their design decisions. As a result, the team frequently had to do rework and had no idea if their designs were effective or usable for their customers.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>I started working with the client through one workshop, “Usability Testing at Any Budget and Any Size". The goal was to get the designers and business to realize they did not need a large budget or a lot of experience to make data-informed decisions. After a successful workshop, I engaged with the team on a part-time several month basis. I taught them how and what to track in Google Analytics, as well as helped them to come up with a usability testing strategy. </p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>Usability Testing</li>
          <li>Google Analytics</li>
          <li>Communicating UX</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The team was able to successfully implement a usability testing strategy, pulling from their own customer base and like-minded consumers. They started doing “ride alongs” when the marketing team did field research, so they could gain more direct customer interactions and experience with testing. When designs are produced, events in Google Analytics are created to measure workflows and adoption rates.</p>
