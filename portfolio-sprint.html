        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>A local user experience team worked asynchronously from their developers, sometimes as far as six months ahead of time. When it came time for developer implementation, requirements had changed and screens frequently had to be redesigned. The team was looking to work in a more agile fashion, while still being able to think “big picture”.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>Working with the head of the UX team I explored a number of options for tracking UX on an incremental level, settling on Trello as our best option. For agile UX, we broke down items from project level to tasks that were able to be completed in a two week time frame. We still wanted to think on a larger scale, so we introduced design sprints. I facilitated their first design sprint, trying to figure out what best would work for that company. We built up a process for them, which they have since used several times in their own design sprints.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The team was able to reduce rework and work more closely alongside the developers. </p>
        <p>The design sprint that I facilitated produced a product feature that is now a major differentiation over competitors. The team is still continuing a cadence of one design sprint per quarter.
