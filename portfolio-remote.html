        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          I led a small user experience team that was distributed across several clients. While we were all living in the greater metropolitan area, we very infrequently saw each other. I needed a way for my team to be able to collaborate effectively, without ever physically seeing one another. The opportunity presented itself when we had a client in Portland looking to leverage our UX skills.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>We tried meeting in the office, but inevitably someone would be at a client and not able to make the meeting. We started with Skype for Business and GoTo Meeting. Both were too formal and felt “in the way”. It wasn’t until we embraced fully remote that the team was able to work most effectively. Our team now uses Slack, both for collaboration and chit chat, as well as Trello for keeping track of our tasks.

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>Working Remotely</li>
          <li>Kanban (Trello) Boards</li>
          <li>Online Collaboration Sessions</li>
          <li>Online “water cooler talk” (Slack)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Working remote amongst our team has made us more effective at working with clients, many of which are located across the country.
