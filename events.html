          <h2>Solving What to Solve: UX + Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>Machine Learning is fantastic at solving unique problems in new and exciting ways -- it's an excellent opportunity to discover valuable insights into your data patterns and relationships. But what if you don't know what problems to solve? Or what if you answer a problem that doesn't really exist? UX can help align your machine learning efforts with your users, creating human-centered machine learning with results that are actionable and relevant to your user base.</p>

            <h2>Usability Testing for Anyone Ballin' on a Budget of $0</h2>
            <p>According to Human Factors International, “an estimated 50% of dev rework could have been avoided with usability testing.” Usability testing is an inexpensive, quick and iterative way to get meaningful feedback around product decisions before they make it to the coding stage. It’s easy enough to execute that anyone can do it. We'll walk through a very quick introduction, how to test (even on a budget of $0), and run through some successful case studies.

            <h2>Introduction to Accessibility / Building Accessible Digital Products</h2>
            <p>Anyone should be able to use your website; whether they are blind, deaf, or just have a broken arm. Inclusive design accounts for all of these; it’s a method of thinking that works to provide a more meaningful experience for your entire audience, no matter whom or where they are.</p>
              <p>We’ll walk through a brief introduction to accessibility, why accessibility matters, and the code changes required to be accessibility compliant.   
              Participants will also get a chance to interact with leading accessibility tools and gain first-hand experience of what it is like to use a screen reader, magnifier, and other assistive devices that have a significant impact on how users interact with websites.

            <h2>Talking UX: Lessons From Clients and Conducting Class</h2>
            <p>“That’s what we saw in user testing”, “it’s just a well known design practice”, “that’s what it’s like for UX people in the real world”.
            </p><p>Sound familiar? Instead of relying on adages, learn how to communicate more effectively with clients, stakeholders and even students. Ashley and Amii will leverage their time as UX leads, as well as adjunct teaching, to provide some tips and tidbits from their own experiences. Expect a fairly informal presentation with a Q&A session to follow.
