        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          The path to user experience is different for most individuals; until very recently user experience was not taught at a collegiate level or discussed at many companies. The result is a fractured user experience community of individuals who do not have traditional networks available to them. I started as a software developer with no idea what “user experience” was; it took me several years and positions before I finally found what I wanted to do.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>I founded <a href="https://www.meetup.com/brewcityux" alt="meetup">Brew City UX,</a> a monthly meetup focused on promoting user experience in the community and furthering education and networking for UX professionals. We’ve only been around for a year but we’ve already made a huge impact in the community. Our average attendance is 45-50 people, with about half of them brand new. We have attendees from every major company and are continuing outreach.
